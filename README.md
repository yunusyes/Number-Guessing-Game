# Number-Guessing-Game

This program is a number guessing game where users attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100. Upon starting the game, players are prompted to enter their guesses. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. If the input is not a valid number, an error message is displayed. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number, at which point the program reveals the correct answer and the total number of guesses made.
